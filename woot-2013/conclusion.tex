\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we investigated the usefulness of harnessing printers as nodes in a bitcoin mining operation.
While the number of devices available to take advantage of is high, the performance of each printer is poor.
Commercial graphics processing units can achieve as high as 1.
2 gighashes/second, whereas dedicated hardware can reach astounding benchmarks that come out to 1.
5 terahashes/second[3].
Unfortunately, printers cannot even remotely compare, as they mine at 52 hashes/second.
Even though the implementation used in this paper was not perfect, as it had a lot of room for optimization, these numbers are astronomically different.
